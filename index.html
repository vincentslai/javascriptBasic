		<h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
		<p>Javascript is cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremly popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lighweight language allowing maxium flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are container for storing data value - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variable must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></li>
			<li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assign a value to a variable. <span> var x = 10;</span></li>
			<li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
			<li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different action for different decision - hitting different code blocks based on value or conditions that has been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following coditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is ture, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
			<li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kind of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then  you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
			<li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an exmple imagine we are putting together a desk from ikea, we open up the instructions. Sadly there are tons more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again/</li>
